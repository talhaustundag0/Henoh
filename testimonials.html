                        I bought this bike as I still wanted a workout when I ride with my wife who has a 750W Ebike. I wasn't able to keep up on our return trip uphill and into the wind on most days. The Henoh X1 did exactly what I wanted it to do. The gearing is perfect at 58/22, very similar to my middle front chain ring and 5th gear on my 9-speed cassette on my pedal bike. Super happy with my Henoh X1, it handles great when stand up pedaling. I use a my Garmin so I can compare my cadence and heart rate to my pedal bike on the same ride. I went from burning 700 calories to 500, max HR went from 161 to 151, cadence was very similar on our almost 900' of climb 17.5 mile loop. The difference is I can now keep up on the inward half and my wife isn't waiting for me.

                        This bike is awesome. I've had it for a month now and I've been riding it everyday since I got it. The look is incredible, it<br>
                        doesn't even look like an ebike. For the price and the quality you get, can't beat it. This is a great commuter bike. Not to mention, it only weighs 36 pounds! I highly recommend purchasing this bike. You won't regret it. I'm not a fan of the straight bar so I changed it to the bullhorn handlebars as I honestly think it looks better with it.

                        Better quality, get more for the money, I had a Babymaker and sold it for this bike. It's way better all around. More range, and feels a lot more powerful on inclines.

The quality is outstanding and lives up to the advertisements and prior reviews. I would recommend and have recommended it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, electrically-assisted bicycle.

                        The Henoh X1 is my 5th Ebike since 2012. I upgraded fenders & tires for durability & to be maintenance free. The price of this amazing Ebike was thought to be a mistake....it wasn't. E-bikes weighing 36lbs are generally $2500-$5000. .....(and you lowered the price?? )....I also padded my Henoh X1 & moved the digital for obvious reasons. The 3-level pedal assist is great. I've had the entire summer of 2021 to enjoy the Henoh X1. No e-bike I've ever owned has met the excellence of the Henoh X1. I've had 5.

The gearing without the assist is so smooth (even without gears) that assist is not necessary on flat or slight uphills. If that is your ride profile, this bike is PERFECT. This is so much more than a road bike!

                        The bike came almost all assembled and was easy to assemble myself. sturdy and performs as advertised. I have only used it on flat or semi-graded paths and roads so far but it went smooth and fast..I was going top speed of 24 mph on the flat…very fun! Solid well built bike…
